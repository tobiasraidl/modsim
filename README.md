# Agent Based Opinion Model
Random, grid and network structured agent based opinion models.

## Random Model
Configurate model parameters in params.yaml
Execute server.py in order to run the model

## Grid Model
The grid size is always NUMBER_AGENTS x NUMBER_AGENTS

## Network Model

## TODO
- Make initial opinion distribution normal
- Implement logic for agents to not move on occupied fields
- Implement easy switch between random and grid version (boolean in param.yaml?)
- ...

### If time
- make dynamic lineplot
